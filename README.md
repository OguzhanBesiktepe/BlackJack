Blackjack Game
Welcome to the Blackjack Game! This is a simple, interactive Blackjack game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Game Overview
The objective of the game is to reach a sum of cards equal to or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. The player draws cards, and the game checks if the sum is 21 (Blackjack), under 21 (allowing the player to draw more cards), or over 21 (the player loses). The game is managed entirely in the browser using the DOM.

How to Play:
Click on the START GAME button to begin. You will be dealt two cards.
Check the sum of your cards:
If your sum is under 21, you can choose to draw a NEW CARD.
If you hit exactly 21, congratulations—you’ve got Blackjack!
If your sum exceeds 21, you lose.
The goal is to reach as close to 21 as possible without going over.

Key Features:
A random card generator that simulates drawing cards from a deck.
The player starts with two random cards and can choose to draw more.
The game provides real-time updates on the sum of the cards and game status.
Interactive UI with buttons for starting the game and drawing new cards.

What I Learned:

This project allowed me to enhance my understanding of key programming concepts such as:

Arrays: I learned how to store and manipulate collections of data (cards) using arrays.
Objects: Creating and using objects to manage related data (e.g., the player object).
Booleans: Managing game states with boolean variables.
If-else statements: Implementing decision-making in the game logic.
Comparison and Logical Operators: Evaluating conditions and combining logic in the game.
For Loops: Iterating over arrays to display content dynamically.
Math Object: Generating random values, essential for simulating card draws.
Return Statements: Understanding the importance of returning values from functions to control game flow.

How to Run the Project:

To run this project, simply clone the repository and open the index.html file in your browser. The game will be ready to play immediately!
